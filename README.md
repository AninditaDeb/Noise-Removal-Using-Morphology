# NoiseRemovalUsingMorphology && Panaroma formation
Edge Detection.py - It contains the functionalities to implement Edge Detection Algorithm.
Panaroma.py - It contains functionalities from both open cv as well as python to implement and compute homography , RANSAC and KNN algorithms to find the correspondences between left and right images
Reduced_noise_using_morphological_operations.py- Contains the below functionalties-
1)Remove noise within the image using erosion followed by dialation.
2)Remove the noise outside the image using dialation followed by erosion.
